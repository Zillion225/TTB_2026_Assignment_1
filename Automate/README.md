# Python Script Assignments

This repository contains two Python scripts that perform simple data manipulation tasks.

## Requirements

## Setup

No special setup or installation of external libraries is required. You just need to have a compatible version of Python installed on your system.

## Running the Scripts

You can run the scripts directly from your terminal.
